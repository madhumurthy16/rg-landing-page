# Rooster Grin Media Landing Page

A landing page application for Rooster Grin Media website.

Technologies used: **ReactJS, React Router, HTML5, CSS and Bootstrap.** I recently learned React and wanted to challenge myself to build something new and apply my new gained skills and aslo learn more things along the way. App was built using create-react-app.

One of the challenges I faced was appling animations to the React app. I had not done this previously and after reading up I learned that applying animations to React app is different from a Javascript application, beacause of the way React uses DOM to render components (Virtual DOM).

I enjoyed building the app with React. Eversince I learned React I wanted to build more apps for practice and was excited to use React for this project.
